1) mathematica notebook paths are too big in some cases.

2) remaining gutter problems: too-big-table.

3) fix "equation grammar", adding commas and periods, and adjusting new paragraphs.

4) switch link in

   when a new version is posted.

  change link into bib reference: \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7743774/proper-way-to-simplify-integral-result-in-mathematica-given-integer-constraints}{stackoverflow} ...

  so that it can be looked up in text form.  For now I've just commented it out.

want:

  added to myrefs:

5) spell check chapters.tex and rest of the .tex files.

6) shorten section names so they don't go out of the printable region.

7) figures without valid captions:

qmTwoL2fig1
qmTwoL2fig2
qmTwoL2fig3
qmTwoL2fig4
qmTwoL2fig5
qmTwoL2fig6
qmTwoL21Fig9
qmTwoL9fig7

8) L24: "and can as in" what is meant here?

9) indexing:
   (indexed the chapter and section headings)
   - visit all the subsection/paragraph/problem markers

10) use nicer table formatting (like gabook)

11) customize the dedication and change the rules to avoid the generic one being used (do this for phy485)

12) would be nice to restructure to have a more systematic layout.  Put the various worked problems and notes from the readings as problems at chapter ends for example.

   - started this.  problem set 1 moved into place (not all of it fits, perhaps move 1a to appendix)

   - thought I'd work through problem sets, adding descriptions and makeproblem/answer env,
      and move into place along with the lecture notes ...

      However, I can only find ps1 written up?

      Perhaps all the problem
      sets were ungraded and I only did them on paper (I have all those qmII notebooks ...
      maybe I kept them because I intended to review what I'd done).

   - have two mathematica references in "phy456/problems/variationalHelium.tex" ... convert to nbref

   - delete most of the initial attempt garbage in "./problems/variationHarmonicOscillator.tex" and just leave the part where it's done right (perhaps with a comment about why the niave attempt doesn't work).





======================================================

- update page count on my blog when I repost the next version.

- update chapter layout on my blog when I repost the next version.

- can make part (.) reference a hyperlink with exersize env.

   where?

- ./phy456/problems/qmTwoPs4.tex:13:I was deceived by an incorrect result in Mathematica, which led me to believe that the second order energy perturbation was zero (whereas part (c) of the problem asked if it was greater or lesser than zero).  I started starting writing this up to show my reasoning, but our Professor quickly provided an example after class showing how this zero must be wrong, and I did not have to show him any of this.
